Opening:

The Glorious Kingdom of the United States has discovered a magical source of Democracy.
Help bring this magic to your village and watch the people flourish!

Question 1:

You approach a spring rumored to be the source of Democracy. Unfortunately, it is guarded by a fiendish gnome
who poses the most challenging riddle you have ever heard.

"Are you a United States Citizen?" it croaks with a devilish grin.

[input] Yes | No

if Yes:

"Drat! You chose correctly!  I cannot deny your access to the magical source of Democracy.  You may proceed."
The Gnome disapears.

if No:

"You are not a United States citizen?  You may not continue on this quest until you gain citizenship!"
