Opening:

The Glorious Kingdom of the United States has discovered a magical source of Democracy.
Help bring this magic to your village and watch the people flourish!

Question 1:

You approach a spring rumored to be the source of Democracy. Unfortunately, it is guarded by a fiendish gnome
who poses the most challenging riddle you have ever heard.

"Are you a United States Citizen?" it croaks with a devilish grin.

[input] Yes | No

if Yes:

"Drat! You chose correctly!  I cannot deny your access to the magical source of Democracy.  You may proceed."
The Gnome disapears.

if No:

"You are not a United States citizen?  You may not continue on this quest until you gain citizenship!"

Question 2:

You scoop a flask into the cool waters that flow with magical democracy and recall a lyric
you once heard a bard singing in a tavern:

"Will you be 18 years of age on or before election day?"
Yes|No

if Yes:

The flask fills with the magical liquid.  You turn away from the spring and begin the journey back to your village.

If No:

Try as you might, the flask will not fill.  Your hand is too young to wield this type of magic.

Question 3:

You walk through the forest admiring the flask as the sun's light gleams through its magical contents.
You consider, "Have I embarked on this journey to apply the magic of democracy before?

Application Type:

You shake your head confidently and think, "Of course, I knew that."
